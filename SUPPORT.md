## Bug Reports

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ChesterRa/cccc/issues) and include:

- **Version**: output of `cccc version`
- **OS and CCCC version**: e.g., macOS 14.2 and the output of `cccc version`

- **Exact command**: the full command you ran
- **Actual output**: copy-paste the error or unexpected behavior
- **Expected behavior**: what you expected to happen
- **Reproduction steps**: minimal steps to trigger the issue

If the issue involves the daemon, include relevant lines from `~/.cccc/daemon/ccccd.log`.

## Feature Requests

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ChesterRa/cccc/issues) with:

- **Problem statement**: what workflow is difficult or impossible today
- **Proposed behavior**: how you'd like it to work
- **Operational impact**: how this affects your multi-agent setup

## Security Issues

Please report security vulnerabilities privately. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for instructions.

## Operational Notes

- CCCC is **local-first**. All runtime state lives under `CCCC_HOME` (default `~/.cccc/`), not in your repository.
- The daemon is the single source of truth. If something looks wrong, check `cccc daemon status` first.
- For recovery procedures, see the [Operations Runbook](https://chesterra.github.io/cccc/guide/operations).
